<small> I am a M.Tech. student in the Electrical Engineering discipline at [Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/) since July 2018. I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Shanmuganathan Raman](http://people.iitgn.ac.in/~shanmuga/index.html). My research interests lie in Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Image Processing. 
<!-- My Ph.D. thesis is closely related to the tasks which involve moving objects present in videos or images captured from different view-points. I am actively working with deep neural networks for videos and image sequences. I have experience of working with convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and generative adversarial networks. In my research works, I utilize the information provided by the moving regions present in videos or multi-view image sequences to solve problems like action recognition, dynamic object detection, and image sequencing. I also explore the advantages of using multiple images of a scene over a single image. -->
