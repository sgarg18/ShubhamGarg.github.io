<small> I am a Ph.D. student in the Electrical Engineering discipline at [Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/) since May 2015. I am working under the supervision of [Prof. Shanmuganathan Raman](http://people.iitgn.ac.in/~shanmuga/index.html). My research interests lie in Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Computational Photography. My Ph.D. thesis is closely related to the tasks which involve moving objects present in videos or images captured from different view-points. I am actively working with deep neural networks for videos and image sequences. I have experience of working with convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and generative adversarial networks. In my research works, I utilize the information provided by the moving regions present in videos or multi-view image sequences to solve problems like action recognition, dynamic object detection, and image sequencing. I also explore the advantages of using multiple images of a scene over a single image.
